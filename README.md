Purpose
An open-source ventilator is a disaster-situation ventilator made using a freely-licensed (open source) design, and ideally, freely-available components and parts (open-source hardware). Designs, components, and parts may be anywhere from completely reverse engineered or completely new creations, components may be adaptations of various inexpensive existing products, and special hard-to-find and/or expensive parts may be 3D printed instead of purchased.
